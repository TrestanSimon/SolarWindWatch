# SolarWindWatch

SolarWindWatch is a dynamic, web-based visualization that aims to communicate real-time solar wind data to a general, nonspecialist audience. It uses the Space Weather Prediction Center's [Real-Time Solar Wind](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/products/real-time-solar-wind) data.

SolarWindWatch was originally created as a solo project during the 2022 NASA International Space Apps Challenge, a hackathon held 1-2 October 2022.
